[{"available":false,"name":"Phenol from salycilic acid","chemFormula":"C6H6O","description":"A practical and quantified method for the preparation of phenol from inexpensive, readily accessible starting materials is something that, to the best of my knowledge, does not yet exist on this forum. Methods such as the cumene process or direct oxidation of benzene require specialized catalysts and conditions that are not amenable to amateur experimentation. Diazotisation of aniline yields phenol upon warming the solution of diazonium salt, but aniline is itself a difficult to acquire or tedious to make chemical. Fusion of benzenesulfonates with molten alkali hydroxides furnishes phenol, but benzenesulfonic acid is typically prepared with oleum and the alkali fusion is unpleasant at best.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has heated salicylic acid knows that it decarboxylates to phenol, as is evident from its powerful smell. However, conversion is far from quantitative through brief heating, so more controlled conditions are required for an isolatable yield. One such procedure comes from another amateur experimentation forum, versuchschemie.de Suspecting that the stated 40% yield could be improved, I did some of my own experimentation.\r\n\r\nThe salicylic acid used was prepared from acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) recrystallized from acetone.

When PA is heated (to form PAN) without the addition of an azeotroping agent, the amount of water liberated is inadequate to produce the desired product. Moreover, a large proportion of the thus-formed water of reaction runs back into the formed melt, resulting in a reformation of PA. The conversion is low and the produced PAN has a high acid number. The sublimation of PAN also presents difficulties in this mode of operation by clogging the withdrawal lines.\r\n\r\nAttempts to overcome these difficulties by the use of conventional azeotropic agents, such as toluene, diethylbenzene, cumene and diisopropylbenzene, yield only unsatisfactory results. Although, under these conditions, obstructions by sublimate in the gas and condensation chamber are avoided, the reaction rate is too low, and too high a concentration of free acid remains in the melt. Obviously, the temperature of the melt, due to the formation of the azeotropic mixture, is reduced to such an extent that the production of PAN can take place only very sluggishly.\r\n\r\nConsequently, there is need for a commercially feasible process to convert ortho-phthalic acid readily and completely into the anhydride on an industrial scale.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are fundamentally different conventional methods for preparing PA (Kirk-Othmer, \"Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology.\" 2nd Edition, Vol. 15, page 450, (1968), and the conversion of PA to PAN is not dependent upon the method according to which the PA was prepared, there is an additional advantage to the instant method for preparing PAN when the PA starting material is conventionally obtained by oxidizing o-xylene in the liquid phase, for example with air, in glacial acetic acid in the presence of a bromine-activated soluble heavy metal catalyst system.","methods":"","makesChemicals":[{"inStorage":false,"bAllNames":true,"bAppearance":true,"bMolarMass":true,"bDensity":true,"bMeltingPoint":true,"bBoilingPoint":true,"bSInWater":true,"bVapourPressure":true,"bAcidity":false,"bFlashPoint":true,"bLD50":true,"bLC50":false,"bSolubility":false,"bWikiLink":true,"bPurchaseLink":false,"bMSDS":false,"hazards":[{"symbols":"AcutelyToxic","description":"Toxic material which may cause life threatening effects even in small amounts and with short duration."},{"symbols":"Corrosive","description":"Corrosive material which may cause skin burns and permanent eye damage.

The principal use for MnO\r\n2 is for dry-cell batteries, such as the alkaline battery and the zinc–carbon battery. MnO\r\n2 is also used as a pigment and as a precursor to other manganese compounds, such as KMnO\r\n4. It is used as a reagent in organic synthesis, for example, for the oxidation of allylic alcohols. MnO\r\n2 is α polymorph that can incorporate a variety of atoms (as well as water molecules) in the \"tunnels\" or \"channels\" between the manganese oxide octahedra.

It is an ionic salt of potassium ions K+ and nitrate ions NO3−, and is therefore an alkali metal nitrate. It occurs in nature as a mineral, niter (or nitre in the UK). It is a source of nitrogen, and nitrogen was named after niter. Potassium nitrate is one of several nitrogen-containing compounds collectively referred to as saltpetre (or saltpeter in North America).\r\n\r\nMajor uses of potassium nitrate are in fertilizers, tree stump removal, rocket propellants and fireworks.
