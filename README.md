### Project Management Software for Chemists.

## About
### 1. What it is

Chemlist is an application meant to help hobbyist chemists keep track of their chemicals and projects.

A project contains compounds. If you have all of the required chemicals in your storage, the project becomes available. A project can also contain child projects. If all children are achievable, the parent project becomes available too.
